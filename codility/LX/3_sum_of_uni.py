Problem 3: Sum of UNI(S') (Contribution Technique)

Task Description
Let UNI(S) be defined as the number of unique characters that occur
exactly once in string S.
Example: UNI("ABACX") = 2 (only 'C' and 'X' appear once).

Given a string S, calculate the sum of UNI(S') for all possible
non-empty substrings S'. Since the result can be very large,
return the value modulo 1,000,000,007.

Goal: Write a function that returns the sum of UNI values over all substrings.

Constraints:
- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000].
- S consists of uppercase English letters.
