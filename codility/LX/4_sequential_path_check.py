Problem 4: Sequential Path Check (Graph)

Task Description
You are given an undirected graph with N vertices (numbered 1 to N)
and M edges. The edges are described by two arrays A and B, where
(A[i], B[i]) represents an edge between city A[i] and city B[i].

Your task is to determine if there exists a direct path that visits
all vertices from 1 to N in strictly increasing order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> N).

Goal: Write a function that returns True if the path 1 -> 2 -> ... -> N
exists using the given edges, and False otherwise.

Constraints:
- N is an integer within the range [1..100,000].
- M is an integer within the range [1..200,000].
