Problem 5: Hospital Road Reorientation (Tree/BFS)

Task Description
A network consists of N cities (labeled 0 to N-1) connected by N-1 roads
forming a tree structure. Each road is initially oriented in one direction
(from A[i] to B[i]).

A hospital is located in City 0. The citizens want to reorient the minimum
number of roads so that every city has a fast path to the hospital.
A path is "fast" if it does not go against the direction of any road.

Goal: Write a function that returns the minimum number of roads that must
be flipped (reoriented) so that every city can reach City 0 following
the road directions.

Constraints:
- N-1 is the number of roads (N cities).
- The network is guaranteed to be a tree.
